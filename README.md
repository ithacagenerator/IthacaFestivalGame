We're making a short "carnival" game for the Ithaca Festival in which teams of four pass a light around to score points in a game of eight rounds. The game rewards equal turn taking. Points are scored as follows:

0 point if the light goes out before it's passed eight times (the light goes out if one player holds it for too long)

1 point if the team passes the light 8 times

2 points if the team passes the light equally among the team members (each player has it twice)

POINTS will be visualized on a scoreboard

The team with the highest score throughout the 4 day festival wins something special (not sure what yet)
